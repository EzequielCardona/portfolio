# Ezequiel Cardona's Portfolio

This is a portfolio web app built with React.Js and Node.js, with only a client module and harcoded data in the frontend as it's where it scales to.
Probably in the future if I want to add further functionalities I can add an API app to serve this client app or use a full stack tool like Next.js.

It is open source as it proves my skills as a developer.
For anybody comming for reviewing my code capabilities or simply looking for ways to acomplish certain functionality and taking examples from this, please feel welcomed!

The app is entirely informative. As major things it has some cool animation orchestration at the intro and in elements view, theme and language toggling.

It's running a Redux instance for controlling these global togglings and other controls. The style is succeded with material UI and the framer-motion library.
